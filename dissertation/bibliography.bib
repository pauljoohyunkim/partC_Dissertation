We prove continuous and compact embeddings, investigating the problem of the extension domains and other regularity results. Most of the results we present here are probably well known to the experts, but we believe that our proofs are original and we do not make use of any interpolation techniques nor pass through the theory of Besov spaces. We also present some counterexamples in non-Lipschitz domains.}

Those systems frequently occur in various areas, e. g. interpolation by spline functions, numerical solution of elliptic differential equations, etc.. The function is based on a modification of the cyclic reduction method [1], [2]. Time measurements show impressive speed-ups over the domino ( ) function and the APL2 versions of the Gaussian elimination method, specialized for cyclic tridiagonal and tridiagonal systems.},

    abstract = { In the last chapter, Newton's method was shown to be locally q-quadratically convergent. This means that when the current solution approximation is good enough, it will be improved rapidly and with relative ease. Unfortunately, it is not unusual to expend significant computational effort in getting close enough. In addition, the strategies for getting close constitute the major part of the program and the programming effort, and they can be sensitive to small differences in implementation. }

Because of the nature of discretisation, there is no guarantee that a curve would not intersect;
this implies that the implementation of the curve untangling process must be carefully designed.

While this dissertation focused on $L^2$ and $H^1$ gradient flow for the untangling process,
for given $\alpha$ and $\beta$ values for the tangent-point energy,
there is an optimal choice of space for one to implement the curve untangling process,
which makes the evolution by (\ref{equ: Finite Difference Scheme for Curve Untangling Process}) the fastest
and its computation trivial.

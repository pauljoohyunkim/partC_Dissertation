\begin{document}
We have defined tangent-point energy quadrature for simple closed curve (any curve homeomorphic to circle) $\gammabf$ at (\ref{equ: Tangent-Point Energy Quadrature}).

For curves in different homeomorphism class from $S^1$,
one may make minor changes to (\ref{equ: Tangent-Point Energy Quadrature}) to get a sensible quadrature.
